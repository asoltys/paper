# Bitcoin Paper Wallet

A tool to create and spend from old school paper wallets, i.e. with just a single address and private key. No BIP39 seed phrases or BIP32 HD wallet stuff here. 

It does BIP38 password encryption on the private key.

It's not well tested and I'm no security expert so don't use with any serious amount of money. I made it for me.
